# Macquarie University Thesis Quarto Template <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15133161/200966938-ba6f8413-fa77-4ccb-b16d-d7cf14926057.png" align="right" width="150"/>

This project is our attempt to bring our `thesisdownmq` package to everyone! Unlike R Markdown and our previous work on `thesisdownmq`, Quarto doesn't have a dependency or requirement for `R`. Quarto was developed to be multilingual, beginning with `R`, `Python`, `Javascript`, and `Julia`, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don't yet exist.

Please note that most of the Quarto Project structure we utilised here was inspired by the [Monash University Thesis Template of \@robjhyndman.](https://github.com/numbats/monash-quarto-thesis)

Here is a preview on what the thesis looks like: ![](https://github.com/thomas-fung/mq-thesis-quarto/assets/15133161/a3572f0c-cffb-4e0d-9b22-dd8a1c22a7a7)

Currently, the PDF version is fully-functional (The word, gitbook and epub versions are developmental, have no templates behind them, and are essentially calls to the appropriate functions via Quarto.)

Under the hood, the Reed College \LaTeX{} template was updated to ensure that documents conform precisely to submission standards at Macquarie University. At the same time, composition and formatting can be done using lightweight markdown syntax, and code from your favourite language and its output can be seamlessly included using rmarkdown.

Using Quaro has some prerequisites which are described below. To compile PDF documents, you are going to need to have \LaTeX{} installed. It can be downloaded for Windows at http://http://miktex.org/download and for Mac at http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html. (If you are an R user, we recommend you to install the `tinytex` package instead.) Follow the instructions to install the necessary packages after downloading the (somewhat large) installer files. You may need to install a few extra \LaTeX{} packages on your first attempt to knit as well.

An example of the thesis template can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/thomas-fung/mq-thesis-quarto/blob/main/examples/sample.pdf.

### Installing Quarto

Use the following link to install Quarto:

https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

Notice that it should come with the more recent versions of `RStudio`.

### Installing the template from Thomas Fung's GitHub

You can use this as a template to create a report. To do this, use the following command in your Terminal:

``` bash
quarto use template thomas-fung/mq-thesis-quarto
```

This will install the extension and download a bunch of qmd files (basically one per chapter) that you can use as a starting place for your thesis.

To compile your thesis into a pdf, use the following command in your terminal

``` bash
quarto render --to mqthesis-pdf
```

or if you are an R user, type the following command in your R console

``` bash
library(quarto)
quarto_render(output_format = "mqthesis-pdf")
```

Please notice that the file `_quarto.yml` contains all the reuqired `YAML` information of the document.
